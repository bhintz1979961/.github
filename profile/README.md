Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with extensive experience in building robust applications and solutions. My primary focus is on backend development, but I also have a keen interest in frontend technologies. I have a strong command of programming languages including Python, JavaScript, and Java, as well as experience with C# for cross-platform development.

I specialize in frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Express.js for backend services, while using React.js and Angular for crafting dynamic user interfaces. My expertise extends to working with various databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL, ensuring data integrity and efficiency in data operations.

With over 5 years of industry experience, I have honed my skills in agile development methodologies, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and version control systems such as Git. My approach involves writing clean, maintainable code, and adhering to best practices to deliver high-quality software solutions.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. Recently, I have been exploring cloud computing services like AWS and Azure, as well as containerization tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to enhance deployment processes and scalability of applications. In addition, I have a growing interest in machine learning, and I am currently working on personal projects that involve data analysis and model building.

Feel free to browse through my pinned repositories which showcase some of my best work, including:

- A RESTful API built with Django and PostgreSQL.
- A full-stack project using React and Node.js, featuring user authentication and CRUD operations.
- A machine learning project predicting housing prices based on various parameters.

Thank you for visiting my profile! I always appreciate feedback and collaboration opportunities, so don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in working together or if you have any questions about my projects. Happy coding!
